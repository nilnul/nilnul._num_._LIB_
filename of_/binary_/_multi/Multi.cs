		/*
	The Schönhage–Strassen algorithm is an asymptotically fast multiplication algorithm for large integers.It was developed by Arnold Schönhage and Volker Strassen in 1971.[1] The run-time bit complexity is, in Big O notation, O(n log n log log n) for two n-digit numbers.The algorithm uses recursive Fast Fourier transforms in rings with 22n + 1 elements, a specific type of number theoretic transform.

The Schönhage–Strassen algorithm was the asymptotically fastest multiplication method known from 1971 until 2007, when a new method, Fürer's algorithm, was announced with lower asymptotic complexity;[2] however, Fürer's algorithm currently only achieves an advantage for astronomically large values and is not used in practice.
