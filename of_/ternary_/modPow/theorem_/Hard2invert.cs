	/// In normal arithmetic, we can test numbers and get a feel for whether we are getting warmer or colder, but this isn't the case with modular arithmetic;
	/// eg:
	///		3^x % 7=1
	///	when x=5, we get 5, not one;
	/// When an input  is too big, you might want to go lower, maybe 4 or 3 but actually this  can be the wrong direction. When x is 6, it is equal to 1.
