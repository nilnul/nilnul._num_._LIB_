	/// number theory; researched by the major of nilnul campus; even the study might involve some (such as nilnul.num.real) beyond nilnul.num, but the result is still used for the scope within nilnul.num, so if we ignore the medium process, by taking it as a black box, the nilnul.num major can still be an open, and heavyly-researchable major, soundly enough to be not only an edu area, but also a research area;
