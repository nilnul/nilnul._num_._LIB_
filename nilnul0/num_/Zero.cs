	/// Let's explain this by example.
	/// Say, you are at a bus stop, wondering where to go. Somebody tells you to go further three stops. So which stop should you be at next?
	/// If you index your current stop as 0, the immediate next stop is then indexed 1, then the next two will be indexed as 2, 3 respectively.
	/// If you go further 3 stops, you will be at the stop indexed by 3. 
	/// See, index your current stop with 1, making the count of stops you should go further and the index of your destination the same.
