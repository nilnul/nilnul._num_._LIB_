	/*Eventually, Gauss noticed that in many ways, -1 was algebraically more similar to 1 than prime numbers were, and instead classified them as "units" (because they evenly divide all whole numbers).  This was a good idea because when he developed the Gaussian integers (2 dimensional integers), he found that i and -i also fit this definition, and was able to come up with a new type of unique factorization, with a special case for units.  This turned out to be a REALLY good idea, as the concept further generalizes to rings of integers for arbitrary number fields, polynomial rings, and integral domains in general.  

In a sense, you can think of the primes as the numbers that create structure in the number system, while the units are the "structure-less" numbers.﻿
