	/// The following variant of Euclid's formula is sometimes more convenient, as being closer to symmetric in m and n.
	/// If m and n are two odd integers such that m > n, then
	/// a = m n ,    b = (m^2   − n^2 ) /   2   ,    c = (m 2   + n 2 )/   2    
	/// are three integers that form a Pythagorean triple, which is primitive if and only if m and n are coprime.Conversely, every primitive Pythagorean triple arises(after the exchange of a and b, if a is even) from a unique pair m > n > 0 of coprime odd integers.
