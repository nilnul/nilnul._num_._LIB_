	/*Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

For other theorems named after Pierre de Fermat, see Fermat's theorem.
In additive number theory, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares states that an odd prime p can be expressed as:
 p=x^{2}+y^{2} 

with x and y integers, if and only if
p ≡ 1 ( mod 4 ) .

The prime numbers for which this is true are called Pythagorean primes. For example, the primes 5, 13, 17, 29, 37 and 41 are all congruent to 1 modulo 4, and they can be expressed as sums of two squares in the following ways:
 5=1^{2}+2^{2}, 13=2^{2}+3^{2}, 17=1^{2}+4^{2},
 29=2^{2}+5^{2}, 37=1^{2}+6^{2}, 41=4^{2}+5^{2}.} 

On the other hand, the primes 3, 7, 11, 19, 23 and 31 are all congruent to 3 modulo 4, and none of them can be expressed as the sum of two squares. This is the easier part of the theorem, and follows immediately from the observation that all squares are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.*/
